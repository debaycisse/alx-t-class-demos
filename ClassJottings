-- Manipulating & Querying Data
-- Insert a few records into both drivers and vehicles.

insert into drivers(first_name, last_name)
values ('Amy','Hua'),
('Azeez','Adebayo'),
('Khadijat','Adebayo'),
('Elon','Musk'),
('Seidu','Sule');


-- INSERT INTO vehicles(make, model, driver_id)
-- VALUES('Avalon','2018 (XX50)', 1),
-- ('Camry','2017 (XV70)', 2),
-- ('Century','2018 (G60)', 3);

-- select *, vehicles.make, vehicles.model from drivers
-- join vehicles
-- on drivers.id = vehicles.driver_id


-- Include 3 records of drivers who have vehicles, 
-- belonging in the vehicles table.



-- Select all driver records; select all vehicle records; 
-- select only 3 vehicle records (using LIMIT)



-- Driver with ID 2 no longer owns any vehicles. Update the 
-- database to reflect this.



-- Driver with ID 1 now owns a new vehicle in addition to the 
-- previous one they owned. Update the database to reflect this.










select * from drivers;
